# SystemMonitor

The purpose of this app is to record various system metrics to a SQLite DB to help diagnose crashes and stuff. I made this because my desktop was crashing for no reason and I needed to see what I could see.

Works on both Windows and Linux. Haven't tried on MacOS. 

No idea if I'll ever come back to this; was created for a specific point in time for a specific use. You're welcome to fork, contribute, and generally do whatever with this.
